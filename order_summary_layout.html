If you remember we were having issue finding where this is located. We have now managed to find the HTML on the previous email that called to it attached is a screenshot. This shows how it looks on the orders page. The data is shown in the menu on the right.



In the original HTML first ever design by client they showed me where all of this is called to. Lines 1196 to 1230. I have attached a HTML screenshot and the original HTML again {File: Order confirmation_29_01_26}



Attached is a PDF of a confirmation sent to a customer using the old email template {PDF: Wheelwiz · Orders · 44808 · Shopify Plus} As you can see it has pulled in the vehicle information (shown after shipping information) & if there are order notes they are also pulled in.



So as a breakdown. Lines 1196 to 1230 in file Order confirmation_29_01_26 are what shows the order notes and vehicle information shown in Screenshot of order page.



We would need this added to our template in the vehicle information section and order notes section at the top of the email.
